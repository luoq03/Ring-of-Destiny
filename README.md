# **Ring-of-Destiny**
Coding 1 Final Project

## Project Overview ##
This is my final project, the theme of which is the Ring of Destiny. It describes a scenario in which, as the population continues to grow, the energy supply on earth becomes a bottleneck for human development. Attempts are made to amplify spiritual power and transform it into energy machines so that human civilisation can continue to develop at a high rate.
